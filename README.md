# Plant Disease Classification with Custom CNN

This project demonstrates how to build, train, evaluate, and deploy a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for plant disease classification using PyTorch and torchvision. The notebook walks through the entire deep learning workflow, from data preparation to model evaluation and prediction.

## üìö What I Learned

- **PyTorch & Torchvision Libraries:**  
  Learned about essential libraries for deep learning, including how to import and use them for model building, data loading, and transformations.

- **Custom Dataset Import:**  
  Explored how to import custom datasets from the internet, organize them, and use `ImageFolder` and `DataLoader` to efficiently load and batch image data for training and validation.

- **Data Transformations:**  
  Applied various image transformations (resizing, augmentation, normalization) to improve model robustness and performance. Understood the importance of different transforms for training and validation/test sets.

- **CNN Architecture Design:**  
  Discovered how increasing the number of convolutional blocks and stacking layers in the sequence `Conv2d ‚Üí BatchNorm2d ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí MaxPool2d` can significantly improve model performance.

- **Linear Layer Sizing:**  
  Learned to determine the correct input size for the final linear layer in the classifier by passing a random image through the convolutional blocks and checking the output shape.

- **Training & Validation Loops:**  
  Built modular `train_step()` and `valid_step()` functions, and combined them into a unified `train()` function for streamlined training and evaluation.

- **Model Checkpointing:**  
  Implemented logic to check if a trained model already exists. If so, the model is loaded and evaluated; if not, it is trained, evaluated, and then saved for future use.

- **Performance Visualization:**  
  Plotted loss and accuracy curves to monitor training progress, and generated a confusion matrix to analyze model predictions and class-wise performance.

- **Test Set Prediction:**  
  Used the trained model to predict on unseen test images, achieving significant success and demonstrating the model's practical utility.

## üèÜ Results & Outputs

- **High Validation Accuracy:**  
  The final CNN model achieved strong validation accuracy, indicating effective learning and generalization.

- **Loss & Accuracy Curves:**  
  Plotted curves showed steady improvement and convergence during training.

- **Confusion Matrix:**  
  The confusion matrix revealed that the model predicts most classes accurately, with minimal confusion between similar diseases.

- **Test Predictions:**  
  The model performed well on the test set, correctly identifying plant diseases in most cases.
